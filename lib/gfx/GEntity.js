	Data:
		show: boolean, if false the GEntity is hidden
		persistent: if the GEntity persists on scene changes (default: yes)
		roles: the roles that see this GEntity, null: use the GScene roles (the default)
		usage: the usage for the GEntity, depend on engine, but here are some standard values:
			- portrait: the GEntity is a portrait, e.g. a speaking NPC, the portrait is overlayed on top of the eventual scene, usually light doesn't affect it
			- sprite: a sprite on the scene, sprite and portrait are the same on the default GScene engine
			- card: cards have special features, see the standard web client
			...
		button: a button id or null, if set clicking on the GEntity is like clicking on the related button
		theme: the texture theme used, null: use the GScene theme (the default)
		texture: (mandatory) the texture pack to use
		variant: the variant to use (default: default), e.g.: 'standing', 'attack', etc...
		location: string, may be relevant only in some engine, e.g. cards or markers in the classic web client engine
		pose: string, may be relevant only in some engine, e.g. cards in the classic web client engine
		position: Vector3D (x,y,z), the position of the GEntity, depending on the engine and the usage, z may or may not be relevant
		size: Vector3D (x,y,z), the size of the GEntity, depending on the engine and the usage, z may or may not be relevant
		rotation: TO BE DEFINED... quaternion? euler? anyone?
		animation: TO BE DEFINED... animation exists in the current version of spellcast web client, but it should probably be refactored
		tags: (NOT CODED) a Set of tags, used for filtering G-entities
		transition: if there is transition for this GEntity, an object with value passed to the Transition constructor, key being:
			position: ...
			size: ...
			rotation: ...
			opacity: transparency and alpha channel
			color: all color changes, like brightness, contrast, color dodge, make the GEntity redish/blueish/whateverish, darker, brighter, flash, and so on
			effect: all other effect, like blur, or any possible filter, like drop shadow
		engine: object, engine-specific data, e.g.:
			class: the GEntity class (for HTML/CSS engines)
			style: CSS style (for HTML/CSS engines)
			imageStyle: CSS style (for HTML/CSS engines) for the image only (for things like cards, or anything where the image is embedded inside something else)
			maskStyle: CSS style (for HTML/CSS engines) for the mask of the sprite only (for things like sprite in the classic web client)
			backImageStyle: CSS style (for HTML/CSS engines) for the back-image only (back of the cards)
			content: CSS style (for HTML/CSS engines) for the text content of a card
			vgObject: object, for GEntity with usage=vg, this define the Vector Graphics
			vg: for markers, this is the vg id on which the marker is on
			area: object, for GEntity with usage=vg, this defines multiple areas
			shader: for WebGL engines
