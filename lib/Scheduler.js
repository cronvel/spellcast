	Breaking:
	When an performer is messing with another, it can 'break' its action: the performer's phase go immediately to 'recovering'.
	If the performer is releasing, it is to late to break it, but the recovery time will be the greatest of
	the action recovery time and the break recovery time.

	Cancelling:
	Only possible when the performer is 'preparing'. The performer switch immediately to the 'recovering' state, with a lesser recovery time.
